## Installation

You can install {fcall} from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ketchbrookanalytics/fcall")
```

## Background

FCA publishes Call Report data on a quarterly basis at [https://www.fca.gov/bank-oversight/call-report-data-for-download](https://www.fca.gov/bank-oversight/call-report-data-for-download).

As of September 2023, this data represents a set of 72 *.TXT* files. These files represent 36 datasets. The files prefixed with "D_" contain *metadata* (the column names, data types, etc.) of the associated file containing the raw, header-less comma-separated data. For example, the file that starts with *"D_INST"* contains the metadata for the file that starts with *"INST_"*.

Further, some of these datasets are structured in a way that makes data analysis difficult. In these cases, we chose to pivot the data to make it more analysis-friendly. See [Metadata File Scenarios](#metadata-file-scenarios) for a more in-depth discussion of when and how this pivoting took place.

This package provides 3 utility functions:

1. `download_data()` allows users to programmatically download (and unzip) data from a specific quarter
2. `process_data()` parses the data from these unzipped *.TXT* files into a list of R data frames containing the Call Report data and file metadata
3. `compare_metadata()` compares two sets of Call Report data from different quarters

Check out the [Getting Started](https://ketchbrookanalytics.github.io/fcall/articles/getting-started.html) vignette to learn more about these three core functions.

## Database

[Ketchbrook Analytics](https://www.ketchbrookanalytics.com/) has also created a PostgreSQL database to store historical FCA Call Report data in a traditional, relational schema that aligns with the output data frame structure resulting from running `process_data()`. This database allows users to execute SQL queries to easily analyze Call Report data across multiple quarters.

Please reach out to [info@ketchbrookanalytics.com](mailto:info@ketchbrookanalytics.com?subject=FCA%20Call%20Report%20Database) if you would like access to this database.
