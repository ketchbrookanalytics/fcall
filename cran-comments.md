## Resubmission

This is a resubmission of a package that has not yet been on CRAN.; the initial attempt was rejected. In this version I have made the following changes:

* Removed use of bare "FCA" abbreviation in `DESCRIPTION`
* Removed section of README which included bad hyperlinks
* Removed improper use of hyperlink markdown `< >` characters in `download_data()` roxygen comments
