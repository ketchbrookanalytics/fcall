## Resubmission

This is a resubmission of a package that has not yet been on CRAN.; the initial two attempts were rejected. In this version I have made the following changes:

* Removed second "Description:" from the Description field in `DESCRIPTION`
* Removed single quotes around 'FCA' acronym in `DESCRIPTION`
* Replaced `\dontrun{}` with `\donttest{}` in examples that download data (Note: all examples involve downloading data)
